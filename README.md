* [Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket):
    * made a lot of custom assets that legacy uses,
    * gave me a lot of advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such,
    * programmed simply judgements and background darken
    * basically co-owns the engine lmao;
* [Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari):
    * BANGER ASS PROGRAMER,
