  <h1 align="center">Forever Engine Legacy</h1>
  <h2 align="center">An open-source, quality of life and performance driven Friday Night Funkin' mod engine!</h2>
</p>

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine is currently in *legacy* state as it is being rewritten. 

The legacy version of Forever Engine lacks accessibility and cohesion, something we are currently working to fix with the more newer and updated rewrite.

**FOREVER ENGINE LEGACY IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES/PROBLEMS WITH HTML5, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HTML5.**

----------------------------------------------
# Features:
* Noteskins;
* Custom UIs;
* Options Menu with FPS Capping and Adjustments;
* A lot of modularity and freedom with options
    * (Hopefully in the future *everything* will be toggleable);
* A restructure/partial remake of the base game's codebase;
* ``source/`` folder abstraction;
* More streamlined code
    * (only having to set things in one place).

AND MORE!
