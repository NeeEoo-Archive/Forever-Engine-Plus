# How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the [setup.bat](/setup-files/setup.bat).

Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. 

If you've already worked with Funkin', this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.

If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
