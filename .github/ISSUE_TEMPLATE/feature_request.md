**Prerequisites:**
Once again, PLEASE ensure that the feature you are requesting will benefit the ENGINE as a whole, not just a specific mod.

**Information:**
BEFORE requesting any features, keep in mind that this current fork of Forever Engine is a LEGACY fork. That means that it is working to preserve any changes on a fundamental level. Any requests or features that affect the structure, would require extensive testing or maintenance, or do not properly benefit the engine itself will not be approved. Any features that are suggestions for mods will not be approved. Any features that are for the sole benefit of the person requesting them will also not be accepted. Features should generally benefit everyone, and suggestions will very rarely be taken unless they are critical to the maintenance of the LEGACY Forever Engine fork. Thank you.
