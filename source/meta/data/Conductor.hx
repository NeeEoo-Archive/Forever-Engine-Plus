/*
	Stuff like this is why this is a mod engine and not a rewrite.
	I'm not going to pretend to know what any of this does and I don't really have the motivation to
	go through it and rewrite it if I think it works just fine, but there are other aspects that I wanted to
	change about the game entirely which I wanted to rewrite so that's why I made this.

	I'll take a look later if it's important for anything. Otherwise, I don't think this code needs to be edited
	for things like other mods and such, maybe for base engine functions. who knows? we'll see.

	Told myself I wasn't gonna bother with this cus I was lazy but now I actually have to and I hate myself for not doing it earlier!
